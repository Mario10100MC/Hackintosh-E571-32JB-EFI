# Hackintosh-E571-32JB-EFI
An Hackintosh EFI Specifically for the Acer Aspire E5-571-32JB
All of the EFIs are modified from the Olarila's EFIs - https://olarila.com

EFI in Order

**BS-OC** - Big Sur/Catalina(Opencore) **The Recomended EFI**
```
this efi is actually the lightest of the ones in here(Roughly 12-13ish MB uncompressed), 
because it uses different kexts than the CTLNA-OC and even the CTLNA-CLVR
though you will be needing to inject the VodooHDA.kext to an kext injectior of some kind

the actual missing functionality on all of these EFIs are the bluetooth function presumably?
Edit 9/5/2021 - It Is Working on Catalina Too(with ethernet)
```

**CTLNA-OC** - Catalina(Opencore)

**CTLNA-CLVR** - Catalina(Clover)
```
I Presume that the CTLNA-CLVR could work with mojave, or older maybe High Sierra?
```
